Moreover, validators may lower this value if they see commissions have become expensive. The gas fee, like many other parameters of TON, is configurable and may be changed by a special vote made in the mainnet. Fees on TON are difficult to calculate in advance, as their amount depends on transaction run time, account status, message content and size, blockchain network settings, and a number of other variables that cannot be calculated until the transaction is sent.',
